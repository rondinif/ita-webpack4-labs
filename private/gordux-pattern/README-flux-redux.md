implented with no framework at all

is stated that Redux combines the ideas from:

- [The Command pattern]()
- [The Elm Architecture]()

using message-passing (also known as [event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)) to manage application state

think of **state** as being in a **"predictable container"** that only changes as a reaction to these "events".

The nice part about this is not having to defensively check if anything has changed before processing interactions. Is there an alternative to this which doesnâ€™t require being defensive on the interaction side?
